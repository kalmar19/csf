Problem 3 (Creating Dictionaries):
Create an empty dictionary called "ages". This dictionary will have peoples' names
for "keys" and ages for "values." Enter the following into your ages dictionary:
Nicholas is 28, Mary is 21, and Ulises is 14.

By the end, your dictionary should look like this:

ages = {'Nicholas':28, 'Mary':21, 'Ulises':14}

Problem 4 (Calling a function)

def date_of_birth(name):
    dob = 2013 - name
    print "She was born in " + str(dob) + "."
    
#What would you put in this line to call the function date_of_birth to find out
#Mary's birth year?

date_of_birth(Mary)

Call function date_of_birth to find out Mary's birth year.
