Programming as a Way of Life
Homework 6 Problems

Group 15 / Pair 5
Group Member 1 Nicholas Hefling
Group Member 2 Mary Kallem
Group Member 3 Ulises Herrera

Problem 3 (Creating Dictionaries):
Create an empty dictionary called "ages". This dictionary will have peoples' names
for "keys" and ages for "values." Enter the following into your ages dictionary:
Nicholas is 28, Mary is 21, and Ulises is 14.

By the end, your dictionary should look like this:

ages = {'Nicholas':28, 'Mary':21, 'Ulises':14}

Problem 4 (Calling a function)

def date_of_birth(age):
    dob = 2013 - age
    print "She was born in " + str(dob) + "."
    
What would you put in this line to call the function date_of_birth to find out
Mary's birth year?

date_of_birth(ages['Mary'])

Call function date_of_birth to find out Mary's birth year.

Problem 5 (Assertions)
Explain what an assertion does. Why is this useful?
Write an assertion that involves Nicholas.

Problem 6 (Using assertions for two different dictionaries)

Create a new dictionary from your group's names and ages. Write an assertion that 
tests that the sum of our group's ages is greater than the sum of your group's ages.
Hint: Use the "sum('dictionary name'.values)" function!

Problem 7 (New Dictionaries!)
It's ten years later!

Write a function that adds 10 years to each person in the dictionary, such that your output is exactly this:

{'Ulises': 24, 'Nicholas': 38, 'Mary': 31}

Hint: use a similar function to: "sum('dictionary name'.values)"
