Problem 3 (Creating Dictionaries):
Create an empty dictionary called "ages". This dictionary will have peoples' names
for keys and ages for values. Enter the following into your ages dictionary:
Nicholas is 28, Mary is 21, and Ulises is 14.

By the end, your dictionary should look like this:

Ages = {'Nicholas':28, 'Mary':21, 'Ulises':14}

Problem 4 (Calling a function)

def date_of_birth(name):
    dob = 2013 - name
