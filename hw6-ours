Problem 3 (Creating Dictionaries):
Create an empty dictionary called ages. Now add keys and values to this dictionary. 
This dictionary will tell us that Nicholas is 28, Mary is 21, and Ulises is 14. 
We will later use this dictionary in a function.

By the end, your dictionary should look like this:
Ages = {'Nicholas':28, 'Mary':21, 'Ulises':14}


Problem 4 (Calling a function)

def date_of_birth(name):
    dob = 2013 - name
    print "She was born in " + str(dob) + "."

Call function date_of_birth to find out Mary's birth year.

Now add your and your groups ages to the dictionary our_ages

Problem 5 (Calling Functions to Create Dictionaries)

Mary = 21
Nicholas = 28
